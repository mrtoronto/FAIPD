## Credit

Back-bone of application is from Miguel Grinberg's [Flask Mega-Tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world), branched roughly around lesson 12. Highly recommend the tutorial for anyone looking to learn more about Flask.


## Chris look
Chris you can check if I'm hosting it at http://192.168.0.7:5000/

## Virtual Environment
I'd actually recommend a virtual environment for this.

### PC
```
python -m venv <environment name>
<environment name>/Scripts/activate.bat
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
...
<environment name>/Scripts/deactivate.bat

```
### MAC
```
python -m venv <environment name>
source <environment name>/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
...
deactivate
```
