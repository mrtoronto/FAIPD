Back-bone of applicatio is from Miguel Grinberg's [Flask Mega-Tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world), branched roughly around lesson 12. Highly recommend the tutorial for anyone looking to learn more about Flask.

I'd actually recommend a virtual environment for this.

```
python -m venv <environment name>
<environment name>/Scripts/activate.bat
...
<environment name>/Scripts/deactivate.bat

```
OR
```
python -m venv <environment name>
source <environment name>/bin/activate
...
deactivate
```
